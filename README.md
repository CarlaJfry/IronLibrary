# 📚 Facilitating Library Management 📚

Helping to manage and acquire data about the books that are being used by students, IronLibrary is an exceptional Management System designed to simplify the management of issues. Our clear documentation will walk you through the core features of the system, ensuring a user-friendly interface.

## 💻 How to run the App 💻

To run IronLibrary locally, simply follow the below steps:

1. Clone the project from our GitHub repository using the command: `git clone https://github.com/CarlaJfry/IronLibrary.git`
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).
3. Navigate to the `src/main/java/ironhack/IronLibrary` directory and run the `IronLibraryApplication.java` file.
4. The application will launch in the console, and you can begin using it to manage your library's day-to-day activities.

## 📝 How it works 📝

A list of options is displayed to the user, along with a corresponding number for each option. The user then has to input a number corresponding to the action they want to perform. Based on the user's input, the corresponding action is executed. The actions include adding a book, searching for a book, issuing a book for a student, etc. After a certain action is executed, the menu is re-displayed for the user automatically.

The menu that offers several options for managing your library include:

- `Add a book`: Allows you to add a book to the database in two phases. In the first phase by creating and saving a book with an isbn, title, category and number of books. In the second phase by creating and saving an author, inserting their name and e-mail. 
- `Search book by title`: Allows you to look for a book by inserting the title of the book.
- `Search book by category`: Allows you to look for a book by inserting the category of the book.
- `Search book by Author`: Allows you to look for a book by inserting the author of the book.
- `List all books along with author`: Lets you get a list of all the books along with the author's information.  
- `Issue book to student`: Allows you to create an issue by inserting the student's usn, the issue and return date, and the book's ISBN.  
- `Exit`: Allows you to finish the process whenever you want to.
